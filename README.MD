# Danmakufu ph3 Documentation

This is the Offline Documentation for Touhou Danmakufu ph3 as downloaded from the official website. The backup was made October 2, 2018 in advance of the Geocities Japan termination of service.

The files here were downloaded from <http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/9951/pre/th_dnh_ph3.html>.

The site is live at <https://thelandofcodesandapertures.github.io/Danmakufu-ph3-Official-Documentation/th_dnh_help_v3.html>, but you need to set your text encoding to Shift JIS for the content to render.

If the live version of GitHub pages continues to exhibit issues with text encoding, downloading the repository to your computer and opening the docs locally *might* automatically detect the Shift JIS and render appropriately, though this is platform and browser dependent.
